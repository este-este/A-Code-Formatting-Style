# A-Code-Formatting-Style

**A-Code-Formatting-Style** (*ACFS*) is a set of guidelines that prioritize code **readability** over code compactness.  It manages whitespace, density, and code element alignment so the reader can more easily discern and navigate the written code structure. *ACFS* was created for those who cares about *making life easier for their "future self" and others who may later read their code*.

For those familiar with other code formatting styles, these guidelines combine what I consider the best of the Allman and GNU styles.  

To support *ACFS*, a .clang-format file was created to auto-format using these guidelines (or at least as close as possible, given the current constraints of clang-format).  The Windows version of the current clang-format.exe (v19.1.6) is also provided.  See the comments inside the .clang-format file for more information.

*Happy Coding!*
